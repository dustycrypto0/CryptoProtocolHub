# Security Policy

## Security Principles
Security and user safety are top priorities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a potential security issue:
- Do NOT disclose sensitive details publicly
- Provide a high-level description without exposing exploits

## Important Warnings
We will NEVER:
- Ask for private keys
- Ask for seed phrases
- Ask you to connect your wallet
- Ask for payment to resolve issues

Any account doing so is fraudulent.

## Public Transparency
All legitimate updates and fixes will be communicated openly through this repository.
